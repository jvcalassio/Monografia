I would like to dedicate this work primarily to my mother, Vilma. She have always known the impact that education has on the life of a person and the ones around them. Ever since I was a child, I have always been incentivized to dedicate myself, and told that by doing that I would have a bright future. In fact, she have always done everything that she could to provide me with the best condition to achieve that future, and I certainly wouldn't be here if it wasn't for all of her efforts. I will forever be grateful.

I would also like to thank for my dearest friends, Diego, Liverson and Lucius that have always been with me since school, and also thank the wonderful friends that I made on the way: Adelson, Breno, Carlos, Gabriel, João Pedro, José, Matheus, Vinicius, Yuri, William, and many others

With deepest gratitude, 

João Victor.
